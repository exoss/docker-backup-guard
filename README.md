**Restore Container** is a lightweight, secure, and user-friendly backup solution designed for Docker environments. Optimized for Raspberry Pi (ARM64) and generic Linux servers (AMD64), it provides an all-in-one interface to manage container backups, encryption, and cloud synchronization.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Smart Volume Detection:** Automatically identifies and backs up volumes and bind mounts of containers labeled with `backup.enable=true`.
*   **Security First:** Uses **AES-256** encryption (Fernet) to secure your data before it leaves the server.
*   **Cloud Sync:** Integrated **Rclone** support to sync encrypted backups to Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, or any other cloud provider.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Fully localized UI in **English**, **Türkçe**, and **Deutsch**.
*   **Notifications:** Real-time status updates via **Gotify**.
*   **Setup Wizard:** User-friendly initial setup wizard to configure environment variables without touching the terminal.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Docker & Docker Compose installed on your host.
*   An Rclone configuration file (`rclone.conf`) ready.

### Quick Start (Docker Compose)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/exoss/docker-backup-guard.git
    cd restore-container
    ```

2.  **Prepare your Rclone config:**
    Place your `rclone.conf` file in `./config/rclone/rclone.conf`.
    *Important:* Ensure your `RCLONE_REMOTE_NAME` in `.env` matches the remote name defined in `rclone.conf`.

3.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Access the UI:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

### Installation via Portainer Stacks

1.  Log in to Portainer and go to **Stacks**.
2.  Click **Add stack**.
3.  Name it `restore-container`.
4.  Paste the contents of `docker-compose.yml` into the Web Editor.
5.  **Important:** Since Portainer might not have access to `./config/rclone/rclone.conf` relative path easily, it is recommended to use absolute paths for volumes or ensure the file exists on the node.
    Example volume mapping:
    ```yaml
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /path/to/your/backups:/backups
      - /path/to/your/rclone.conf:/app/rclone.conf:ro
      - /var/lib/docker/volumes:/var/lib/docker/volumes:ro
    ```
6.  Click **Deploy the stack**.

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Label Your Containers
To enable backup for a specific container, simply add the following label to its `docker-compose.yml` or run command:

```yaml
labels:
  - "backup.enable=true"
```

### 2. Configure via Wizard
On first launch, you will be greeted by the **Setup Wizard**. Here you can configure:
*   **Portainer & Gotify** credentials.
*   **Backup Password** (Crucial for encryption!).
*   **Retention Policy** (How many days to keep backups).
*   **Rclone Remote Name** (Must match your `rclone.conf`).
*   **Timezone** (Default: Europe/Berlin).

### 3. Backup & Restore
*   Go to the Dashboard.
*   You will see a list of backup-ready containers.
*   Click **Backup** to start the process:
    1.  Container stops.
    2.  Volumes are compressed (`.tar.gz`).
    3.  Archive is encrypted (`.enc`).
    4.  Encrypted file is synced to Cloud (via Rclone).
    5.  Container restarts.

## 🌍 Multi-Language Support
The application automatically detects your language preference during setup. You can choose between:
*   🇬🇧 English
*   🇹🇷 Türkçe
*   🇩🇪 Deutsch

## 🔒 Security Note
*   **Never share your `BACKUP_PASSWORD`.** Without it, your encrypted backups are irretrievable.
*   Sensitive environment variables are stored in `.env` and are never exposed in the UI logs.
