# Release Notes v1.0.1

**Date:** 2026-02-07

This release introduces significant improvements to the notification system, configuration management, and system security, along with critical bug fixes for Raspberry Pi (ARM64) and Rclone integration.

## 🚀 New Features

*   **Gotify Connection Test:** Added a "Test Connection" button in both the Setup Wizard and Settings page to verify Gotify configuration before saving.
*   **Rclone Config Editor:** A dedicated editor in the Settings tab allows you to modify `rclone.conf` directly from the web interface.
*   **Log Management:** Added a "Clear Logs" button to the Dashboard to easily reset system logs.
*   **Secure Docker Access:** Updated architecture to support `socket-proxy`, enhancing security by removing the need to mount the raw Docker socket into the application container.
*   **Multi-Architecture Support:** Automated GitHub Actions workflow now builds and publishes Docker images for both **AMD64** and **ARM64** (Raspberry Pi), resolving `exec format error` issues.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Gotify Notifications:** Fixed an issue where automated scheduled backups failed to send notifications to Gotify.
*   **Rclone Permissions:** Resolved "Permission denied" errors when editing `rclone.conf` by removing the read-only (`:ro`) flag in the default Docker Compose configuration.
*   **Login Performance:** Fixed a 6-7 second delay during login by implementing intelligent caching for container inspection.
*   **Login Error:** Fixed a `KeyError: 'username'` that occurred during the login process.
*   **Docker Mount Detection:** Improved logic to handle cases where `rclone.conf` is mounted as a directory instead of a file.

## ⚡ Improvements

*   **Multilingual Support:** Expanded Turkish (TR), English (EN), and German (DE) translations for new features (Gotify test, Log clearing).
*   **UI/UX:** Moved Language Selection to the Settings tab for better accessibility.
*   **Settings Management:** Settings form now includes an "Unlock / Edit" toggle to prevent accidental changes.
