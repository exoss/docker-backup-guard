# Release Notes v1.0.2

**Date:** 2026-02-08

This release focuses on **reliability and stability**, specifically resolving a critical issue with the automated scheduler and introducing architectural improvements for background tasks.

## 🚀 New Features

*   **Version Display:** The application version (v1.0.2) is now clearly displayed in the sidebar for easier tracking.
*   **Gotify Connection Test:** Added a "Test Connection" button in both the Setup Wizard and Settings page to verify Gotify configuration before saving.
*   **Rclone Config Editor:** A dedicated editor in the Settings tab allows you to modify `rclone.conf` directly from the web interface.
*   **Log Management:** Added a "Clear Logs" button to the Dashboard to easily reset system logs.
*   **Multi-Architecture Support:** Automated GitHub Actions workflow now builds and publishes Docker images for both **AMD64** and **ARM64** (Raspberry Pi).

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **🔥 CRITICAL: Scheduler Reliability:** Fixed a major issue where scheduled backups (e.g., at 03:00) would fail to trigger if the web interface hadn't been accessed after a container restart. The scheduler is now a **standalone service** that starts automatically with the container, ensuring backups run reliably 24/7.
*   **Gotify Notifications:** Fixed an issue where automated scheduled backups failed to send notifications to Gotify.
*   **Rclone Permissions:** Resolved "Permission denied" errors when editing `rclone.conf` by removing the read-only (`:ro`) flag.
*   **Login Performance:** Fixed a 6-7 second delay during login by implementing intelligent caching.

## ⚡ Improvements

*   **Architecture:** Decoupled the Scheduler Service from the Web UI (`ui.py` -> `scheduler_service.py`) for better separation of concerns and system stability.
*   **Startup:** Introduced a new `entrypoint.sh` to manage process lifecycle.
