# Release Notes v1.0.3

**Date:** 2026-02-08

This release focuses on **standardizing and robustifying Healthcheck integrations**, ensuring seamless monitoring via **Healthchecks.io** and **Uptime Kuma**.

## 🚀 New Features

*   **Uptime Kuma Integration:** Added native support for Uptime Kuma "Push" monitors. The system now automatically detects Uptime Kuma URLs and sends `status=up` (success) or `status=down` (failure) signals with appropriate messages.
*   **Healthchecks.io Standardization:** Updated integration to fully comply with Healthchecks.io standards, including `/start` and `/fail` signals for accurate duration tracking and failure alerting.
*   **SSL Robustness:** Added automatic retry logic with SSL verification disabled (`verify=False`) for self-hosted Uptime Kuma instances using self-signed certificates.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Healthcheck Ping:** Fixed an issue where the healthcheck ping might fail or not send the correct status payload.
*   **Process Lifecycle:** Ensured that healthcheck signals are sent at the *start* (for duration tracking) and *end* (success/failure) of the backup process.
